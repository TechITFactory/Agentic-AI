# Section 16: Bonus (Optional but Powerful)

## Overview

Optional deep dives that help you harden systems, control costs, and evaluate agent behavior. Use these modules to push your projects closer to production quality.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Fine-tuning vs RAG**: When to choose each
2. **Cost Optimization**: Caching, batching, rate limits
3. **Agent Evaluation**: Success rate, cost, latency
4. **Production Hardening**: Checklists for reliability
5. **Capstone**: Publish a project and walkthrough video

## Lessons

1. [Fine-tuning vs RAG](./01-finetuning-vs-rag.md)
2. [Cost Optimization Strategies](./02-cost-optimization.md)
3. [Evaluating Agents](./03-agent-evaluation.md)
4. [Production Hardening Checklist](./04-production-hardening.md)
5. [Capstone: Publish and Demo](./05-capstone-publish.md)

## Duration

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours (optional)

## Prerequisites

- Core sections complete (through Section 15)
- At least one portfolio project built

## Outcomes

- A decision framework for RAG vs fine-tuning
- Cost control patterns you can apply immediately
- An evaluation plan for agent reliability and cost
- A published project with a recorded walkthrough

## What's Next?

Use this section to polish and publish your work. Revisit earlier projects and apply the hardening and cost controls where they matter most.
