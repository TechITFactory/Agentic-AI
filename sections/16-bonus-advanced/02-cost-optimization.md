# Cost Optimization: Caching, Batching, Rate Limits

## Why this lesson
Control spend while keeping quality and latency acceptable.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Apply caching and batching strategies
- ✅ Set rate limits and backoff
- ✅ Monitor cost per request

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Tasks
1) Identify cacheable calls
2) Implement basic batching or reuse embeddings
3) Add simple rate limit/backoff logic

## Deliverable
- Cost-control checklist and code snippets

## Checkpoint
Do you know your estimated cost per user flow and how to lower it?
