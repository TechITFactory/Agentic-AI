# Evaluating Agents (Success, Cost, Latency)

## Why this lesson
Measure agent performance beyond “it worked once.”

## Outcomes
- ✅ Define success metrics for agents
- ✅ Track cost and latency per step
- ✅ Collect failure cases for improvement

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Tasks
1) Instrument agent steps with timings and token/cost
2) Define success criteria per task type
3) Log failures with repro data

## Deliverable
- Evaluation plan and instrumentation checklist

## Checkpoint
Can you report success rate and avg cost per task after a test run?
