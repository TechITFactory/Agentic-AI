# Agent Orchestration and Memory

## Why this module

Wire the agent loop and memory so tools can be called coherently.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Plan→Act→Observe→Reflect loop implemented
- ✅ Short-term scratchpad + optional long-term memory
- ✅ Logging across steps

**Time**: ~45 minutes

**Tasks**:

1) Implement loop with state logging
2) Add scratchpad and optional vector/summary memory
3) Define termination conditions

**Deliverable**:

- Agent orchestration code with memory handling

**Checkpoint**:

Can you explain when the agent stops and what it remembers between steps?
