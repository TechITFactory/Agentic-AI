# Guardrails and Safe Actions

## Why this module

Enforce safety so the agent cannot exceed its scope or budget.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Budgets for time/steps/tokens enforced
- ✅ Safe fallbacks and error messaging

**Time**: ~30 minutes

**Tasks
1) Enforce allowlist and budgets in the loop
2) Add redaction/sanitization where needed
3) Define behavior on guardrail violation

**Deliverable
- Guardrail config and code snippets

**Checkpoint
What happens when the agent attempts a disallowed action?
