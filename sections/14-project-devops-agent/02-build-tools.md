# Build Tools: Log Analyzer, K8s Helper, YAML Generator

## Why this module
Implement deterministic tools that the agent will call.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Three working tools with validated inputs
- ✅ Timeouts and error handling inside tools
- ✅ Tests or samples for each tool

**Time**: ~45-60 minutes

**Tasks
1) Implement log analyzer (filter/search patterns)
2) Implement k8s helper (safe, read-focused queries)
3) Implement YAML generator with schema constraints

**Deliverable
- Tool code with docstrings and examples

**Checkpoint
Would any tool perform unsafe mutations or unbounded operations?
