# Mini Lab: Generate Embeddings

## Why this lab
Practice creating embeddings with metadata for downstream search.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Chunk documents and generate embeddings
- ✅ Store vectors with metadata
- ✅ Verify vector counts and dimensions

**Time**: ~45-60 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Lessons 1-4 in this section

## Tasks
1) Choose 3-5 sample documents (PDF/MD/text)
2) Chunk them with your chosen strategy
3) Generate embeddings and store with metadata
4) Verify counts and a few similarity checks

## Deliverables
- Script/notebook producing embeddings store
- Brief note on chunking choices and verification results

## Checkpoint
Can you confirm every chunk has both text and metadata stored?
