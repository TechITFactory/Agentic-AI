# Mini Lab: Vector Search

## Why this lab
Validate your embeddings by running retrieval queries and inspecting relevance.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Run top-k similarity search
- ✅ Inspect retrieved chunks for relevance
- ✅ Adjust chunking/filters based on results

**Time**: ~45 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Prior lab outputs

## Tasks
1) Load your stored embeddings
2) Run 5-10 queries; collect top-k results
3) Evaluate relevance; adjust chunking or filters if needed
4) Summarize findings

## Deliverables
- Notebook/script with queries and retrieved results
- Summary of relevance and planned tweaks

## Checkpoint
Do your top results clearly answer the queries with minimal noise?
