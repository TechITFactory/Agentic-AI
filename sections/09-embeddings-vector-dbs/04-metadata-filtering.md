- ✅ Query with filters (source/type/date)
- ✅ Understand trade-offs of aggressive filtering

**Time**: ~15 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Chunking lesson

## Agenda
- Metadata fields to store
- Filter syntax examples
- Balancing recall vs precision

## Hands-on
- Index chunks with metadata; run a filtered query

## Deliverable
- Query examples showing filtered vs unfiltered results

## Checkpoint
Can you pick filters that remove stale data without losing recall?
