# What Are Embeddings?

## Why this lesson

Understand vector representations so you can build retrieval systems.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Explain embeddings conceptually
- ✅ Know common embedding models and dimensions
- ✅ Understand cosine vs dot similarity basics

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Section 8 fundamentals

## Agenda

- Embeddings intuition
- Common models and vector sizes
- Similarity metrics overview

## Hands-on

- Generate embeddings for a few sentences; inspect vector length
- Compute cosine similarity between pairs

## Deliverable

- Small script showing embeddings and similarity scores

## Checkpoint

Can you explain why normalized vectors matter for cosine similarity?
