# Similarity Search Basics

## Why this lesson

Retrieve relevant items efficiently using vector similarity.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Compute brute-force similarity for small sets
- ✅ Describe ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) need for scale
- ✅ Choose cosine vs dot vs L2 appropriately

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Embeddings lesson

## Agenda

- Brute-force search
- ANN overview (FAISS, Chroma, others)
- Metric choice

## Hands-on

- Implement a simple brute-force search over embeddings
- Compare top-k results for cosine vs dot

## Deliverable

- Script/notebook with top-k retrieval output

## Checkpoint

When would you pick cosine over dot for normalized vectors?
