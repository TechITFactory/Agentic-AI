# Mini Lab: First Baseline Model

## Why this lab

Build and evaluate a simple baseline to anchor future improvements.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Prepare data splits correctly
- ✅ Train a baseline (e.g., logistic regression or mean regressor)
- ✅ Report relevant metrics and a simple improvement plan

**Time**: ~60-90 minutes

**Prerequisites**: All prior Section 3 lessons

## Tasks

1) Load dataset and identify label
2) Create appropriate split (stratified or time-based)
3) Train baseline model; compute core metrics
4) Compare to a naive baseline (majority/mean)
5) Summarize findings and next tweaks

## Deliverables

- Notebook/script with metrics
- Short README with metric summary and next steps

## Checkpoint

Could another engineer reproduce your baseline and understand the next two improvements you’d try?
