# Overfitting and Underfitting

## Why this lesson

Identify when models memorize vs generalize, and how to correct it.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Detect over/underfitting via train/val metrics
- ✅ Apply regularization or complexity controls
- ✅ Communicate the bias-variance tradeoff simply

**Time**: ~25 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Splits lesson

## Agenda

- Signs of under/overfitting
- Regularization and model complexity
- Visualizing learning/validation curves

## Hands-on

- Train a simple model; record train vs val metrics
- Increase complexity; observe metric gap

## Deliverable

- Plot or table showing underfit → good fit → overfit progression

## Checkpoint

Can you propose one change to reduce overfitting in your example?
