# Regression Metrics: MAE and RMSE

## Why this lesson

Quantify regression performance with metrics that match business tolerance.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Compute MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- ✅ Choose MAE vs RMSE based on outlier sensitivity
- ✅ Communicate error in business units

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Splits lesson

## Agenda

- Definitions and intuition
- When to prefer MAE vs RMSE
- Baselines (mean/median predictors)

## Hands-on

- Train a simple regressor and compute metrics
- Compare against mean/median baseline

## Deliverable

- Table of metrics for model vs baseline

## Checkpoint

Can you explain to a PM what RMSE=$50 means in dollar terms?
