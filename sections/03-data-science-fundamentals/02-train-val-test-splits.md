# Train vs Validation vs Test Splits

## Why this lesson

Prevent models from lying to you by separating data for training, tuning, and final evaluation.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Create reproducible splits
- ✅ Explain why validation ≠ test
- ✅ Choose split strategies (random, stratified, time-based)

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Dataset basics

## Agenda

- Purposes of train/val/test
- Stratification for class imbalance
- Time-based splits for temporal data

## Hands-on

- Create random and stratified splits on sample data
- For a timestamped dataset, create a time-based split

## Deliverable

- Short script/notebook that outputs split sizes and class balance

## Checkpoint

Can you justify when to use time-based splits instead of random?
