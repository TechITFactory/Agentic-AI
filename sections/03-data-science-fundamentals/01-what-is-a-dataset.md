# What Is a Dataset? Rows, Columns, Labels, Features

## Why this lesson
Define the building blocks of any ML problem so you reason correctly about data.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Distinguish features vs labels
- ✅ Recognize rows/samples vs columns/fields
- ✅ Identify target leakage risks early

**Time**: ~15 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Section 2 (Pandas basics)

## Agenda
- Anatomy of a tabular dataset
- Feature vs label examples
- Common pitfalls in raw data

## Hands-on
- Inspect a small CSV; mark which column is the label
- List 3 potential leakage columns

## Deliverable
- Markdown note labeling features vs target and suspected leakage fields

## Checkpoint
Can you explain why a post-event column would be leakage for prediction?
