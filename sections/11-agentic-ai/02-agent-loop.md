# Agent Loop Fundamentals (Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect)

## Why this lesson

Understand the control loop that governs agent behavior.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Describe each step of the loop
- ✅ Know where to inject safety checks
- ✅ Log state across steps

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Agents vs chatbots

## Agenda

- Loop breakdown and state
- Termination criteria
- Error handling

## Hands-on

- Pseudocode a basic loop for a two-tool agent

## Deliverable

- Loop pseudocode with safety checkpoints

## Checkpoint

Can you show where you’d stop an infinite loop or budget overrun?
