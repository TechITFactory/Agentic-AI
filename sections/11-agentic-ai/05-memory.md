# Memory for Agents (Short-term vs Long-term)

## Why this lesson
Persist relevant context without blowing context windows or forgetting important state.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Distinguish ephemeral vs persisted memory
- ✅ Choose storage (in-context vs vector/db)
- ✅ Prune/condense history safely

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Guardrails lesson

## Agenda
- Short-term (messages, scratchpad)
- Long-term (summaries, vector stores)
- Retention and redaction

## Hands-on
- Design a simple memory strategy for a ticket-triage agent

## Deliverable
- Memory plan noting what, where, and retention

## Checkpoint
Can you keep critical facts while preventing unbounded history growth?
