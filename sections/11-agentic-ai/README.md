# Section 11: Agentic AI (The Right Way)

## Overview

Move beyond chatbots and design agents that can plan, act, observe, and reflect safely. You will design small, deterministic tools, add guardrails, and build a two-tool agent in a mini lab.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Agent vs Chatbot**: Why agents need tools
2. **Agent Loop**: Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect
3. **Tool Design**: Safe, small, deterministic tools
4. **Guardrails**: Allowlist, timeouts, budgets
5. **Memory**: Short-term vs long-term patterns
6. **Multi-Step Workflows**: Tickets, PRs, runbooks
7. **Mini Lab**: Agent that uses two tools safely

## Lessons

2. [Agent Loop Fundamentals](./02-agent-loop.md)
3. [Designing Safe Tools](./03-tool-design.md)
4. [Guardrails and Budgets](./04-guardrails.md)
5. [Memory for Agents](./05-memory.md)
6. [Multi-Step Workflows](./06-multi-step-workflows.md)
7. [Mini Lab: Two-Tool Agent](./07-mini-lab-two-tool-agent.md)

## Duration

**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

## Prerequisites

- Section 10 completed (RAG End-to-End)
- Comfortable with Python and FastAPI

## What You'll Build

- A tool-using agent with strict guardrails
- Working examples of memory and multi-step execution
