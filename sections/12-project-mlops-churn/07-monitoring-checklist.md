# Monitoring Checklist

## Why this module

Define how you’ll watch the service and detect model degradation.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Service metrics: latency, errors, throughput
- ✅ Model signals: input drift, output distribution
- ✅ Alert thresholds drafted

**Time**: ~25 minutes

**Tasks
1) Choose metrics and logging fields
2) Draft alert thresholds and owners
3) Plan for data/label capture

**Deliverable
- Monitoring doc or dashboard sketch

**Checkpoint
Can you describe how you’d notice drift without labels yet?
