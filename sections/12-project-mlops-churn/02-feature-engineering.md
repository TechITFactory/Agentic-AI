# Feature Engineering

## Why this module
Craft features that improve signal while respecting leakage constraints.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Baseline feature list with rationale
- ✅ Encodings/scaling choices recorded
- ✅ Leakage-checked transformations

**Time**: ~30-45 minutes

**Tasks
1) List raw fields → engineered features
2) Apply scaling/encoding appropriate to models
3) Validate no target/temporal leakage

**Deliverable
- Feature spec and code/notebook implementing transformations

**Checkpoint
Can you explain how each feature is computed without using future info?
