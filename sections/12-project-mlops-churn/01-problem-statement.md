# Problem Statement and Dataset

## Why this module

Define the churn prediction problem, target variable, and data you will use so the team aligns before building.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Clear problem scope and target definition
- ✅ Data sources and schema documented
- ✅ Evaluation goal (metric) agreed

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Tasks
1) Describe business goal and label definition
2) Document dataset schema, splits, and leakage risks
3) Choose primary metrics (e.g., F1/PR-AUC)

**Deliverable
- Problem brief with label definition, metric, and data notes

**Checkpoint
Can any teammate restate the goal and label without ambiguity?
