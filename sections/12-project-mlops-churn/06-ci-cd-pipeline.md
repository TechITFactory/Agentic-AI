# CI/CD Pipeline

## Why this module
Automate testing and shipping so every change is validated and build artifacts are versioned.

## Outcomes
- ✅ CI stages: lint, test, build, push image
- ✅ Tagged images per commit
- ✅ Optional deploy to staging

**Time**: ~45 minutes

**Tasks
1) Author CI workflow (GitHub Actions or similar)
2) Push built image to registry with tags
3) (Optional) add staging deploy job

**Deliverable
- Workflow file and example run screenshot/log

**Checkpoint
Would a failing test stop image build in your pipeline?
