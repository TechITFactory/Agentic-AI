# Prompt Patterns: Zero-shot, Few-shot, Structured

## Why this lesson

Use reusable prompt patterns instead of ad-hoc instructions.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Apply zero-shot and few-shot templates
- ✅ Enforce structured outputs with delimiters and steps
- ✅ Add reasoning cues when needed

**Time**: ~25 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Decoding controls

## Agenda

- Zero-shot vs few-shot
- Delimiters, roles, and stepwise prompts
- When to include chain-of-thought (hidden)

## Hands-on

- Write a zero-shot and a few-shot prompt for the same task
- Add structure instructions to return key/value pairs

## Deliverable

- Prompt snippets demonstrating each pattern

## Checkpoint

Can you convert a loose prompt into a structured one with clear fields?
