# Mini Lab: JSON-Only Assistant

## Why this lab

Practice controlling outputs with JSON mode and schema validation.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Build a small assistant that only returns JSON
- ✅ Validate outputs and retry on failure
- ✅ Log tokens/cost for awareness

**Time**: ~60 minutes

**Prerequisites**: All prior Section 8 lessons

## Tasks

1) Define a JSON schema for responses (fields, types)
2) Call an LLM with JSON mode and your schema
3) Validate response; retry/repair if invalid
4) Log token usage and estimated cost

## Deliverables

- Script/notebook implementing the assistant
- Sample successful and failed responses with handling

## Checkpoint

Would your assistant ever emit free-form text, or is every response valid JSON?
