# Tool and Function Calling Concepts

## Why this lesson
Enable LLMs to act through constrained, deterministic tools.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Describe tool/function calling flow
- ✅ Design small, safe tool signatures
- ✅ Plan guardrails for tool execution

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: JSON mode lesson

## Agenda
- Tool calling lifecycle (plan → call → handle)
- Designing narrow tools
- Safety: allowlists, timeouts, budgets

## Hands-on
- Draft two tool schemas (e.g., search_docs, fetch_record)
- Explain inputs/outputs and constraints

## Deliverable
- Tool specs in Markdown/JSON schema

## Checkpoint
Can you justify why each tool is narrow and deterministic?
