## Repository Structure

Let's explore how the course repository is organized and how to navigate it effectively.

```
Agentic-AI/
├── sections/              # All course sections
│   ├── 01-welcome-setup/
│   ├── 02-python-for-ai/
│   ├── 03-data-science-fundamentals/
│   ├── ... (through 16)
├── datasets/              # Sample datasets for labs
├── shared/                # Shared utilities
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
└── README.md             # Course overview
```

## Section Structure

Each section follows the same structure:

```
sections/XX-section-name/
├── README.md              # Section overview
├── 01-topic-name.md      # Lesson transcript
├── 02-another-topic.md   # Another lesson
├── labs/                 # Hands-on labs
│   ├── lab1_name/
│   │   ├── README.md     # Lab instructions
│   │   ├── starter.py    # Starting code
│   │   └── solution.py   # Solution (don't peek!)
├── code/                 # Code examples
│   └── example1.py
└── assets/               # Images, diagrams (if needed)
```

## How to Navigate the Course

### 1. Start with Section README

Each section has a `README.md` that includes:
- Learning objectives
- List of lessons
- Estimated time
- Prerequisites

**Always read this first!**

### 2. Follow Lessons Sequentially

Lessons are numbered (01, 02, 03...) for a reason - they build on each other.

**Example**: In Section 4 (Machine Learning Basics)
```
01-linear-regression.md       → Understand basics
02-decision-trees.md          → Build on regression
03-random-forests.md          → Ensemble of trees
04-xgboost.md                 → Advanced ensemble
05-mini-project-churn.md      → Apply everything
```

### 3. Code Along, Don't Just Read

When you see code in a lesson:

```python
# DON'T just read this
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# DO: Type it yourself, run it, experiment!
```

**Pro tip**: Type code yourself instead of copy-pasting. Builds muscle memory.

### 4. Complete Labs Before Moving On

Labs reinforce concepts. If you skip them, you'll struggle with later sections.

**Lab workflow**:
1. Read lab README
2. Try coding solution yourself (use `starter.py` if provided)
3. Get stuck? Review lesson
4. Still stuck? Check solution
5. Understand solution, then code it again from scratch

### 5. Projects Are Cumulative

The three main projects (Sections 12-14) use everything from previous sections:

**Project 1 (MLOps Churn)** needs:
- Section 2: Python/Pandas
- Section 3: Data science concepts
- Section 4: ML models
- Section 5: Model serving
- Section 6: Docker/K8s
- Section 7: CI/CD

**Don't skip sections!**

## Using the Course Materials

### Markdown Files (.md)

All lessons are in Markdown format:
- Read in VS Code (opens in preview)
- Read on GitHub (nice formatting)
- Read in any text editor

**VS Code tip**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Cmd+Shift+V on Mac) for preview.

### Python Files (.py)

Code examples you can run directly:

```bash
# Navigate to section
cd sections/02-python-for-ai/code

# Run example
python example_pandas.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)

Interactive notebooks for exploration:

```bash
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Navigate to section and open .ipynb file
```

**Or** open directly in VS Code (if Jupyter extension installed).

### Lab Folders

Each lab is self-contained:

```
labs/lab1_data_cleaning/
├── README.md          # Instructions
├── data/             # Sample data
├── starter.py        # Your starting point
└── solution.py       # Complete solution
```

**Workflow**:
1. Read README.md
2. Work in starter.py (or create your own file)
3. Check solution.py when done (or stuck)

---

## Datasets Directory

Sample datasets for labs and projects:

```
datasets/
├── churn/            # Customer churn data (Section 4, 12)
├── documents/        # Sample docs for RAG (Section 10, 13)
├── logs/            # System logs (Section 2, 14)
└── README.md        # Dataset descriptions
```

**Important**: Some datasets are generated by scripts in their respective sections.

---

## Shared Utilities

Common code used across sections:

```
shared/
├── utils.py          # General utilities
├── ml_helpers.py     # ML helper functions
├── api_helpers.py    # API utilities
└── README.md         # Usage guide
```

**When to use**:
- During projects to avoid code duplication
- When the lesson says "use the shared utility"
- For your own extensions

---

## How to Track Your Progress

### Option 1: Git Branches (Recommended)

Create a branch for your work:

```bash
# Create your branch
git checkout -b my-progress

# Make changes, complete labs
# ... your work ...

# Commit your progress
git add .
git commit -m "Completed Section 2 labs"

# Push to your fork (if you forked the repo)
git push origin my-progress
```

**Benefits**:
- Version control for your work
- Can revert if something breaks
- Shows your progress in GitHub

### Option 2: Checklist in README

Copy this checklist to a file called `MY_PROGRESS.md`:

```markdown

## Working with Code Examples

### Running Examples

Most examples are standalone:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first!
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Navigate to section
cd sections/04-machine-learning-basics/code

# Run example
python linear_regression_example.py
```

### Modifying Examples

**Encouraged!** Experiment with code:

```python
# Original example
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

# Try different parameters
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)

# See how it changes results
```

**Best way to learn**: Break things, fix them, understand why.

### Creating Your Own Files

Feel free to create your own files:

```bash
# Create your playground
mkdir sections/XX-section-name/my_experiments

# Add to .gitignore if you don't want to commit
echo "my_experiments/" >> .gitignore
```

---

## Lab Solutions: When to Use Them

### The Right Approach

1. **First**: Try solving the lab yourself (30-60 minutes)
2. **If stuck**: Review the lesson material
3. **Still stuck**: Look at solution for hints (not full solution)
4. **Last resort**: Study the complete solution

### After Seeing Solution

**Don't just move on!**

1. Close the solution file
2. Code it again from scratch
3. Make sure you understand every line
4. Modify it (try different approaches)

**Learning happens when you struggle, not when you copy.**

## Project Structure

Projects (Sections 12-14) have more complex structure:

```
sections/12-project-mlops-churn/
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── data/                 # Project data
├── notebooks/            # Exploration notebooks
├── src/                  # Source code
│   ├── data_processing.py
│   ├── train.py
│   ├── serve.py
│   └── ...
├── tests/                # Unit tests
├── docker/               # Docker configs
├── k8s/                  # Kubernetes manifests
├── .github/workflows/    # CI/CD configs
└── docs/                 # Project documentation
```

**These are production-style projects.**

---

## Using Git Effectively

### Keep Course Repo Updated

```bash
# Add upstream (original repo) as remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TechITFactory/Agentic-AI.git

# Fetch updates
git fetch upstream

# Merge updates into your branch
git merge upstream/main
```

### Commit Your Work Regularly

```bash
# After completing a lab
git add sections/02-python-for-ai/labs/lab1_cleaning/my_solution.py
git commit -m "Completed data cleaning lab"

# After completing a section
git add sections/02-python-for-ai/
git commit -m "Finished Section 2: Python for AI"
```

### Don't Commit Large Files

Already handled by `.gitignore`:
- Model files (*.pkl, *.h5)
- Large datasets
- Virtual environment
- Cache files

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Create a Learning Schedule

```
Week 1: Section 1-2 (Foundation)
Week 2: Section 3-4 (ML Basics)
...
```

Stick to it!

### 2. Take Notes

Create a `NOTES.md` file:

```markdown
# My Notes

## Section 2: Python for AI

**Key Learnings**:
- Pandas read_csv is simple: `pd.read_csv('file.csv')`
- Always check data types: `df.dtypes`
- Filter with boolean indexing: `df[df['age'] > 30]`

**Mistakes I Made**:
- Forgot to handle missing values before training
- Solution: Use `df.fillna()` or `df.dropna()`
```

### 3. Build a Portfolio Repo

As you complete projects, create a separate portfolio repo:

```
my-ai-portfolio/
├── mlops-churn/       # Project 1
├── rag-assistant/     # Project 2
├── devops-agent/      # Project 3
└── README.md          # Portfolio overview
```

**Share this in job applications!**

### 4. Join the Community

- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions, help others
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs, suggest improvements
- **Twitter/LinkedIn**: Share your progress (#AgenticAI)

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I use a different IDE?

**A**: Yes! PyCharm, Sublime, even Vim/Emacs. VS Code is just recommended.

### Q: Can I use different libraries?

**A**: For learning, stick to course libraries. For projects, customize as you like.

### Q: Should I take notes?

**A**: Yes! Either in Markdown files or a physical notebook. Helps retention.

### Q: Can I skip sections I already know?

**A**: Quick review is fine, but don't skip labs. They may use different approaches than you know.

### Q: What if a dependency breaks?

**A**: Check `requirements.txt` versions. Open an issue if it's a course problem.
