# Retrieval Tuning (Chunks, k, Filters)

## Why this module

Improve hit-rate with informed parameter choices.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Tune chunk size/overlap
- ✅ Select k and filters
- ✅ Measure recall@k on a small golden set

**Time**: ~30-45 minutes

**Tasks**:

1) Run retrieval with multiple chunk sizes/overlaps
2) Try different k and metadata filters
3) Evaluate recall@k and pick defaults

**Deliverable**:

- Eval notebook with recall@k table and chosen params

**Checkpoint**:

Can you justify your chosen chunk size and k with metrics?
