# Embeddings and Vector DB Setup

## Why this module
Prepare the vector store that powers retrieval.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Choose embedding model and DB (FAISS/Chroma/etc.)
- ✅ Store vectors with metadata
- ✅ Verify index build success

**Time**: ~30 minutes

**Tasks
1) Generate embeddings for chunks
2) Upsert into vector DB with metadata
3) Sanity-check counts and dimensions

**Deliverable
- Index build script and verification output

**Checkpoint
Does the number of vectors equal your chunk count?
