# Mini Project: CI/CD for ML Service

## Why this mini project

Wire your model API with tests, CI, and image publishing to prove readiness for production.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Passing tests and lint in CI
- ✅ Image built/pushed from CI
- ✅ Basic deploy step/script ready

**Time**: 2-3 hours

**Prerequisites**: All Section 7 lessons; working API image

## Tasks

1) Add/verify tests and lint commands
2) Author CI workflow (lint → test → build → push)
3) Push to registry (or mock) with tags
4) Optional: add deploy step to staging cluster

## Deliverables

- CI workflow file
- Evidence of CI run (logs/screenshot)

## Checkpoint

Could a reviewer trust your service to ship automatically after a green pipeline?
