# Data Validation Checks

## Why this lesson
Catch bad data before it reaches your model or retraining pipeline.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Define basic schema and range checks
- ✅ Add row/column-level validations
- ✅ Fail fast with actionable errors

**Time**: ~25 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Pandas skills; pipeline basics

## Agenda
- Schema expectations (types, nulls, ranges)
- Simple distribution checks
- Where to place validation in pipeline

## Hands-on
- Implement checks for a churn dataset (types, allowed values)
- Fail the pipeline on violation; log summary

## Deliverable
- Validation module + sample failing run output

## Checkpoint
Would your pipeline stop if a new unexpected category appears?
