# Monitoring Basics: Latency, Errors, Drift

## Why this lesson

Keep the service healthy post-deployment and detect when models degrade.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Define metrics to collect (latency, error rate, drift signals)
- ✅ Set simple alerts
- ✅ Plan data/label collection for evaluation

**Time**: ~25 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Deployed service; basic metrics understanding

## Agenda

- Service vs model metrics
- Simple drift heuristics
- Alerting thresholds

## Hands-on

- Propose log/metric fields to emit from the API
- Sketch drift check using feature distributions

## Deliverable

- Monitoring plan with fields, thresholds, and alert routes

## Checkpoint

Can you tell how you’d detect that churn predictions are drifting without labels yet?
