# Model Versioning Concepts

## Why this lesson

Track which model, data, and code produced each artifact to enable rollbacks and audits.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Version artifacts with semantic or run-based IDs
- ✅ Store metadata (data hash, metrics, params)
- ✅ Understand registry basics

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Model persistence lesson

## Agenda

- What to version (model, data snapshot, code commit)
- Naming conventions and registries
- Promoting models between stages

## Hands-on

- Save a model with a version tag and metadata JSON
- Record git commit and data hash alongside

## Deliverable

- Versioned artifact folder and metadata file

## Checkpoint

Could you answer “which data and code produced this model?” from your records?
