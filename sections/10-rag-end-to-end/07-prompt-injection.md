# Prompt Injection Basics (RAG Security)

## Why this lesson

Protect your system from malicious prompts and document content.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Recognize prompt injection vectors in RAG
- ✅ Add basic defenses (allowlists, sanitization, system prompts)
- ✅ Log and block suspicious patterns

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: RAG pipeline knowledge

## Agenda

- Injection types (doc-based, user prompt)
- Guardrails: system prompts, filters, allowlists
- Monitoring suspicious inputs

## Hands-on

- Add a simple allowlist/denylist filter for queries
- Log flagged requests

## Deliverable

- Security notes and filter code snippet

## Checkpoint

Would your pipeline refuse to execute instructions embedded in source docs?
