# Section 10: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) End-to-End

## Overview

Build a production-grade RAG system that answers questions from documents with proper citations - the most requested AI feature in 2024.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Why RAG Exists**: Solving the hallucination problem
2. **RAG Architecture**: Ingest → Index → Retrieve → Generate
3. **Building RAG Pipeline**: Complete implementation
4. **Improving Retrieval**: Better chunks, better queries
5. **Reranking**: Why retrieval alone isn't enough
6. **Citations & Grounding**: Must-have for enterprise
7. **Prompt Injection**: RAG security basics
8. **Evaluation**: Golden dataset + recall@k
9. **Mini Project**: "Chat with Docs" with citations

## Duration

**Estimated Time**: 12-15 hours

## Prerequisites

- Section 8 completed (LLMs)
- Section 9 completed (Embeddings & Vector DBs)

## What You'll Build

A complete RAG system that:

- Ingests documents (PDF, Markdown)
- Chunks intelligently
- Generates embeddings
- Retrieves relevant context
- Generates answers with citations
- Handles security concerns

## What's Next?

Move to [Section 11: Agentic AI](../11-agentic-ai/README.md) to build autonomous agents.
