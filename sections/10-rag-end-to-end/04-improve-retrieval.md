# Improving Retrieval: Better Chunks + Better Queries

## Why this lesson
Retrieval quality determines answer quality; tune chunking and queries deliberately.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Experiment with chunk sizes/overlaps
- ✅ Compare query rewriting or expansion
- ✅ Measure impact on hit-rate

**Time**: ~30 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Simple RAG pipeline running

## Agenda
- Chunk size/overlap experiments
- Query rewriting/expansion basics
- Measuring recall@k

## Hands-on
- Run retrieval with two chunk strategies; compare recall@k on a small golden set
- Try a simple query rewrite (e.g., add keywords)

## Deliverable
- Table of recall@k per strategy

## Checkpoint
Can you defend your chosen chunk parameters with metrics?
