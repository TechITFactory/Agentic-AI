# Building a Simple RAG Pipeline

## Why this lesson

Assemble a minimal RAG that ingests docs, indexes, retrieves, and answers.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Implement ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval
- ✅ Wire retrieval context into an LLM prompt
- ✅ Return answers with references

**Time**: ~45-60 minutes

**Prerequisites**: RAG architecture; embeddings/vector DB lessons

## Agenda

- Minimal components and choices
- Prompt template for citing sources
- Running end-to-end on sample docs

## Hands-on

- Build a small pipeline on provided docs
- Return answer + top-3 source snippets

## Deliverable

- Script/notebook running end-to-end

## Checkpoint

Does every answer include at least one cited source chunk?
