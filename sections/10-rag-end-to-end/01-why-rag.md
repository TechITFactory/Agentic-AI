# Why RAG Exists (Hallucination Problem)

## Why this lesson

Understand the motivation for RAG so you build it with the right goals and constraints.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Explain hallucinations and knowledge freshness gaps
- ✅ State when RAG is preferable to fine-tuning
- ✅ Identify prerequisites for a successful RAG pipeline

**Time**: ~15 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Section 8 LLM basics; Section 9 embeddings

## Agenda

- Hallucinations and stale knowledge
- RAG vs fine-tuning trade-offs
- Data and infra requirements

## Hands-on

- List 3 use cases where RAG beats fine-tuning

## Deliverable

- Short note mapping a sample use case to RAG justification

## Checkpoint

Can you articulate why RAG improves factuality for doc QA?
