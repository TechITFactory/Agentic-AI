# RAG Architecture: Ingest → Index → Retrieve → Generate

## Why this lesson
Know the standard RAG flow so you can design and debug each stage.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Draw the core RAG pipeline
- ✅ Identify components: ingestion, chunking, embeddings, index, retriever, generator
- ✅ Understand data contracts between stages

**Time**: ~20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Why RAG; embeddings section

## Agenda
- Stage-by-stage overview
- Inputs/outputs per stage
- Failure points and logging needs

## Hands-on
- Sketch your pipeline for the course project

## Deliverable
- Diagram (text or tool) of your RAG flow

## Checkpoint
Can you point to where you’d log and debug retrieval quality?
