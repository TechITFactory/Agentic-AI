# Mini Project: "Chat with Docs" with Citations

## Why this mini project

Ship a usable RAG app that answers with grounded citations and basic defenses.

## Outcomes

- ✅ End-to-end RAG with ingestion, retrieval, generation
- ✅ Answers include citations and handle missing evidence
- ✅ Basic prompt-injection defenses and evaluation

**Time**: 3-4 hours

**Prerequisites**: All Section 10 lessons

## Tasks

1) Build ingestion/chunking + embeddings + index
2) Implement retrieval with optional rerank
3) Prompt for answers with citations; handle no-answer cases
4) Add simple injection guardrails
5) Evaluate on a golden set; report recall@k

## Deliverables

- Working script/app
- Eval results and metrics
- Short README with setup and limitations

## Checkpoint

Can a user ask questions and receive cited answers while injection attempts are blocked?
