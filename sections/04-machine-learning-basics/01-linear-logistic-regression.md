# Linear and Logistic Regression

## Why this lesson
Establish strong baselines for regression and classification before moving to more complex models.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Train and interpret linear regression for continuous targets
- ✅ Train logistic regression for binary targets with proper scaling
- ✅ Read coefficients to explain feature impact
- ✅ Evaluate with MAE/RMSE (regression) and precision/recall/F1 (classification)

**Time**: ~40 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Section 3 metrics and splits, Python/NumPy/Pandas

## Agenda
- Concept refresher: when to use linear vs logistic
- Data prep: scaling and feature selection basics
- Training and evaluation walkthroughs
- Common pitfalls (multicollinearity, class imbalance)

## Hands-on
- Fit linear regression on a numeric dataset; report RMSE
- Fit logistic regression on a binary dataset; report precision/recall/F1
- Inspect coefficients to explain top 3 positive/negative drivers

## Deliverable
- Two short scripts or notebooks showing training, metrics, and coefficient interpretation

## Checkpoint
Can you justify choosing logistic regression over a tree model for a small, wide dataset and explain what its coefficients mean?
