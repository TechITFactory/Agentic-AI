# Section 4: Machine Learning Basics (Practical)

## Overview

Build real ML models with practical, production-ready code. Focus on algorithms commonly used in industry.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Linear & Logistic Regression**: Simple but powerful
2. **Decision Trees**: Interpretable but prone to overfitting
3. **Random Forests**: Strong baseline for most problems
4. **XGBoost**: Industry favorite for structured data
5. **Feature Engineering**: Scaling, encoding, creating features
6. **Model Persistence**: Saving and loading with joblib
7. **Mini Project**: End-to-end churn predictor
