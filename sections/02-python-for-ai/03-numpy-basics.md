# NumPy Basics (Arrays & Ops)

## Why this lesson

NumPy underpins ML/DS; you need array operations for later sections.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Create and reshape arrays
- ✅ Perform vectorized math and boolean masking
- ✅ Understand broadcasting basics

**Time**: ~30 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Python crash course

## Agenda

- Arrays, shapes, dtypes
- Slicing, masking, broadcasting
- Common ops: sum/mean/std, dot

## Hands-on

- Load a small list into np.array; compute column means
- Use boolean mask to filter rows; apply elementwise transform
- Demonstrate broadcasting with column scaling

## Deliverable

- A script/notebook showing these operations on a toy array

## Checkpoint

Can you explain how broadcasting works when scaling each column by a different value?
