# Python Crash Course for AI

## Why this lesson

Give you only the Python you need for the rest of the course without a full CS intro.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Write functions, conditionals, loops, and comprehensions
- ✅ Work with files and modules
- ✅ Follow Python packaging layout for small projects

**Time**: ~45 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Basic programming in any language

## Agenda

- Functions, args/kwargs, return values
- Lists/dicts/sets/tuples; comprehensions
- File I/O and pathlib
- Modules and imports; simple package layout

## Hands-on

- Write a utility that loads a JSON file, filters records, and writes CSV output
- Create a small module with one helper function and import it from another file

## Deliverable

- A tiny script that reads `input.json`, filters rows, writes `output.csv`

## Checkpoint

Can you explain when to use a list vs dict and import your helper from another module without errors?
