# Virtual Environments (venv/conda) + requirements.txt

## Why this lesson
Keep dependencies isolated so your labs and projects run reliably.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Create/activate venv or conda env
- ✅ Freeze deps to requirements.txt
- ✅ Upgrade pip and manage dependency conflicts

**Time**: ~25 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Python installed

## Agenda
- venv basics; activation per OS
- requirements.txt workflow (pip freeze vs curated)
- Pip install from requirements and verify imports

## Hands-on
- Create a venv, install `numpy pandas scikit-learn`, freeze to requirements.txt
- Reactivate and verify imports in a new shell

## Deliverable
- `requirements.txt` and short note on how to recreate the env

## Checkpoint
Can someone else reproduce your environment using your instructions?
