# Mini Lab: User Activity Data Cleaning

## Why this lab

Practice turning messy log-like data into a clean table ready for modeling.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Load raw activity data (JSON/CSV)
- ✅ Clean types, handle nulls, normalize nested fields
- ✅ Produce a tidy CSV for downstream sections

**Time**: ~60-90 minutes

**Prerequisites**: All prior Section 2 lessons

## Tasks

1) Load provided user-activity data (JSON/CSV)
2) Normalize nested structures (e.g., events list)
3) Handle missing values and bad types
4) Output cleaned CSV with documented schema

## Deliverables

- Cleaned `user_activity_clean.csv`
- Short README describing cleaning steps and assumptions

## Checkpoint

Could someone else train a simple model on your cleaned CSV without asking you to clarify the schema?
