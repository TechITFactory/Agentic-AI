# Pandas Essentials (Read, Filter, Join, Groupby)

## Why this lesson
Pandas is your daily driver for data prep before modeling.

## Outcomes
- ✅ Read CSV/JSON
- ✅ Filter/select columns/rows
- ✅ Join/merge datasets
- ✅ Groupby/aggregate

**Time**: ~35 minutes

**Prerequisites**: NumPy basics

## Agenda
- DataFrame/Series basics
- Filtering, sorting, assigning
- Merge types (inner/left)
- Groupby aggregates and pivots

## Hands-on
- Load a CSV; select columns; filter rows by condition
- Merge two small DataFrames; compute groupby aggregates
- Handle missing values with fillna/dropna

## Deliverable
- Script/notebook performing read→filter→join→groupby on sample data

## Checkpoint
Can you join two tables and produce a grouped metric without using loops?
