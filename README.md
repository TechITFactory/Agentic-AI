## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

**"Minimum DS + Maximum Practical"**

This course teaches you what you need to know to build production AI systems, not everything about data science theory. Every concept is immediately applied in code.

### What Makes This Different?

- ✅ **DevOps-First Approach**: ML with deployment, monitoring, CI/CD from day one
- ✅ **Real Code, Real Tools**: Every lab runs locally and is production-ready
- ✅ **Security-Aware**: Prompt injection, data validation, guardrails included
- ✅ **Interview-Ready**: Each project includes talking points for interviews
- ✅ **No Fluff**: Only practical skills that matter in 2024+

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Basic Programming**: Any language (we'll teach Python basics)
- **Command Line**: Comfortable with terminal/bash
- **Git Basics**: Clone, commit, push
- **Curiosity**: Willingness to learn by building

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3.10+
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, numpy
- **LLM Tools**: OpenAI API, LangChain, sentence-transformers
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB, FAISS
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus basics

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

### Perfect For:
- **DevOps/SRE Engineers** wanting to add AI skills
- **Backend Developers** moving into AI engineering
- **Junior ML Engineers** needing production experience
- **Career Switchers** with programming background

### Not For:
- Complete programming beginners (learn Python basics first)
- PhD-level ML researchers (this is practical, not theoretical)
- Those wanting only theory without implementation

## 📖 How to Use This Course

1. **Follow Sequentially**: Sections build on each other
2. **Code Along**: Type the code yourself, don't just copy-paste
3. **Complete All Labs**: Mini labs reinforce concepts
4. **Build All 3 Projects**: These are your portfolio pieces
5. **Customize Projects**: Add your own features to stand out

## 🎬 Section Overview

Each section includes:
- **📄 Transcript**: Detailed explanation of concepts
- **💻 Code Examples**: Working, tested code
- **🧪 Labs**: Hands-on exercises with solutions
- **📊 Datasets**: Real-world data where applicable
- **✅ Checkpoints**: Self-assessment questions

## 🏆 After This Course

You will be able to:
- ✅ Build and deploy ML models as production APIs
- ✅ Create RAG systems with proper retrieval and citations
- ✅ Develop autonomous agents with safety guardrails
- ✅ Set up CI/CD pipelines for ML services
- ✅ Monitor and maintain ML systems in production
- ✅ Ace AI Engineer interviews with real projects
